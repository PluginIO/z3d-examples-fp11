Z3D examples.

Super lightweight, simplified 3D engine.

To use the examples you will require the ```z3d-core-fp11``` package available at:
https://github.com/PluginIO/z3d-core-fp11

I wrote this in one evening as an example 3D engine structure, to be presented at the "Stage3D Online Conference" on the 25th May 2013. The engine does not adhere to best programming practices but instead was designed to be decoupled but implemented in the most lightweight way possible. For that reason, it is good as an educational resource but NOT a practicle 3D engine to be used for large scale projects.

If you require an engine for large scale production, please contact me for details of our full 3D engine implementation http://www.zest3d.com
